                        <p>Our goal is to show that using the Bayesian approach in deep learning models can expand the range of their applicability and improve their performance. Although there are many different problem settings in machine learning, probabilistic inference for Bayesian networks can be performed  in a similar way for most of them.

                                <p>No, candidates will have to complete the application form. The participants will be selected on a competitive basis. Only approved candidates will be asked to proceed with paying the fee. The selection process is necessary because we have a limited number of spots available, and we also want to make sure that our participants have a suitable background to understand the material and have a useful experience at Deep|Bayes School.</p>

                                <p>Unfortunately, no. Our summer school is intended for candidates who have strong knowledge of machine learning and are familiar with neural networks. Such level of participants enables us to delve into to technical details and quickly proceed to advanced topics while being confident that the material is accessible for everyone.  For learning machine learning fundamentals, we encourage you to check out numerous resources available on the web.</p>
